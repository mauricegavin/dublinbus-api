Dublin Bus Real Time API
========================

API access to the [Real Time Passenger Information](http://rtpi.ie/) (RTPI) for Dublin Bus services.

Setup and run the Ruby/Sinatra app yourself or use the existing service at [https://quiet-sands-1191.herokuapp.com/stops](https://quiet-sands-1191.herokuapp.com/stops).
Note that usage of the running service is permitted for non-commercial use only. There are currently no rate
limits but please be respectful with your usage.

Disclaimer
----------

This service is in no way affiliated with Dublin Bus or the providers of the RTPI service.

A warning about the availability of the data from this API. The data is taken from the still-in-development [RTPI](http://rtpi.ie/) site. That site will likely
change greatly in the near future meaning this code will probably break without warning. Even if the
site remains stable, I wouldn't be shocked if The Powers That Be decided this isn't a permitted use
of the data and prevent its use either technically or legally. For now I'm working on the assumption that
the data is free to use since the RTPI site doesn't list any licensing information and doesn't have a
[robots.txt](http://www.robotstxt.org/robotstxt.html).

REST API
--------

The API is exposed as a very simple REST interface. 

JSON is the only format supported. JSONP will be returned if a *callback* parameter is passed.

### Stops

**GET [/stops](https://quiet-sands-1191.herokuapp.com/stops)**

* *range*: return only stops within *range* kilometers of *origin*. Default is unbounded.
* *routes*: return only stops along the comma separated *routes*

**note** results are limited to 30 entries per request, pagination will be implemented

Example: GET [/stops?origin=53.343488,-6.249311&range=0.2&routes=2,3](https://quiet-sands-1191.herokuapp.com/stops?origin=53.343488,-6.249311&range=0.2&routes=2,3)
